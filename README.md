# buubuu
What is buubuu? a simple project to facilitate artists to showcase their work. maybe a little similar to how pixiv works with a few touches to get a different feel in use.
This website will be created using golang and nextjs.
Why was this project created? basically this only facilitates a place to learn, in other words I provide a case study place for your knowledge that if it has anything to do with the technology stack used.

> Tasks:
- [x] Gorm DB connect
- [x] Add migrations function
- [ ] Make SMTP features
- [ ] Make handler(look down)
- [x] Parse HTML file to handler
- [x] JWT for auth with session expired
- [ ] Building dynamic web page (next js, tailwind)
- [x] User validation
- [ ] Docker migration

for the handler we need an <br>
-register and login page (give a link for user features if don't have an account to register)<br>
-index page (to see content stuff) <br>
-profile page (have the ability for users to change their data) <br>
-about page (contributor information) <br>

For the first time, please just make a UI/UX first, I will tell you what data section is needed later.
